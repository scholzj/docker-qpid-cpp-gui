 *
 * ExplorerCanvas - provides HTML5 canvas on IE
 *
 * note that this is using excanvas.js from http://explorercanvas.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ as it happens that's
 * more up to date than the version https://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/downloads/list/excanvas_r3.zip which
 * is the version one gets following the obvious path. Unfortunately excanvas_r3.zip has several bugs in drawImage()
 * which affect the border radius rendering for IE7 canvas, the version from trunk fixes that....
